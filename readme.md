I used the Spotify API and Express framework to explore building a server-side application around a third party API. The primary challenge was handling multiple asynchronous events, which was done through the use of javascript promises. 

The app was originally built without promises (through commit 967fbfb0e46a48ff58464b2c09ec6688125a499d) and later refactored. 

To launch app, clone repo and run ```node server.js``` and navigate to localhost:3000.
